{"name":"OCLC Web Services Library","tagline":"PHP library to access OCLC web services","body":"# PHP Library for [OCLC Web Services][1]\r\nThe library currently supports the following services:\r\n\r\n1. [Classify][2]: classify books, videos, CDs and other materials based on identifier: ISBN, OCLC Number, UPC, ISSN, title, author, FAST headings, or FRBR work identifier.\r\n2. [xID API][13] (partial support): submit an identifer such as an ISBN, ISSN, or OCLC Number to this service, and it returns a list of related identifiers and selected metadata.\r\n\r\nI hope to include the following services in future updates:\r\n\r\n1. [FAST API][3]: access to OCLC's Faceted Application of Subject Terminologies (FAST) subject headings data.\r\n2. [LC Name Authority File (LCNAF)][4]: access to a database of LC Authority records extracted from WorldCat.\r\n3. [QuestionPoint Knowledge Base API][5]: access to QuestionPoint knowledge base Question and Answer (Q&A) pairs that QuestionPoint libraries saved for future re-use, for FAQ pages, for patron searches. The QuestionPoint global knowledge base is a collection of Q&A pairs contributed by nearly 500 libraries worldwide. Local knowledge bases are built and maintained by single libraries or regional library groups and usually contain information more specific to that group.\r\n4. [Terminology Services][6]: access to a suite of seven controlled vocabularies and thesauri.\r\n5. [Virtual International Authority File (VIAF)][7]: authority data from 22 agencies in 19 countries, representing a variety of formats.\r\n6. [WorldCat Identities][8]: service that provides personal, corporate and subject-based identities (writers, authors, characters, corporations, horses, ships, etc.) based on information in WorldCat.\r\n7. [WorldCat knowledge base API][9]: read-only service for e-resource discovery and linking. Provides developer-level access to a library's information in the WorldCat knowledge base. The WorldCat knowledge base combines data about your library's econtent with access to it through linking features.\r\n8. [WorldCat Recommender Service][10]: provides recommendations for books and other materials based on data in WorldCat.\r\n9. [WorldCat Registry][11]: access to information in the Worldcat Registry: a free global directory for libraries, consortia, archives and museums. (http://www.worldcat.org/registry/institutions)\r\n10. [WorldCat Search API][12]: access to WorldCat for bibliographic holdings and location data.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n1. Download the folder and include it in your application's directory.\r\n2. Include desired classes and `OCLCException.php` in any file you want to access the service from.\r\n    - Alternatively, you can use `spl_autoload_register` to automatically load the library into your application. For example, let's say your directory structure looks as follows:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    .\r\n    +-- config.php\r\n    +-- index.php\r\n    +-- libs\r\n    |   +-- OCLC\r\n    |   |   +-- classify\r\n    |   |   +-- â€¦\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    - Place the following in your config file to be included in all your application files:\r\n\r\n    ```php\r\n    function autoload_libs($class_name) {\r\n      $class_name = ltrim($class_name, '\\\\');\r\n      $file_name  = '';\r\n      $namespace = '';\r\n      if ($lastNsPos = strrpos($class_name, '\\\\')) {\r\n        $namespace = substr($class_name, 0, $lastNsPos);\r\n        $class_name = substr($class_name, $lastNsPos + 1);\r\n        $file_name  = __DIR__ . '/libs/' . str_replace('\\\\', DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR, $namespace) . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR;\r\n      }\r\n      $file_name .= str_replace('_', DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR, $class_name) . '.php';\r\n      if(file_exists($file_name)) {\r\n        include_once($file_name);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    spl_autoload_register('autoload_libs');\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n- [Classify](classify/README.md)\r\n- [xID](xid/README.md)\r\n\r\n[1]: http://www.oclc.org/developer/develop/web-services.en.html\r\n[2]: http://www.oclc.org/content/developer/worldwide/en_us/develop/web-services/classify.html\r\n[3]: http://www.oclc.org/developer/develop/web-services/fast-api.en.html\r\n[4]: http://www.oclc.org/developer/develop/web-services/lc-name-authority-file-lcnaf.en.html\r\n[5]: http://www.oclc.org/developer/develop/web-services/questionpoint-knowledge-base-api.en.html\r\n[6]: http://www.oclc.org/developer/develop/web-services/terminology-services.en.html\r\n[7]: http://www.oclc.org/developer/develop/web-services/virtual-international-authority-file-viaf.en.html\r\n[8]: http://www.oclc.org/developer/develop/web-services/worldcat-identities.en.html\r\n[9]: http://www.oclc.org/developer/develop/web-services/worldcat-knowledge-base-api.en.html\r\n[10]: http://www.oclc.org/developer/develop/web-services/worldcat-recommender-service.en.html\r\n[11]: http://www.oclc.org/developer/develop/web-services/worldcat-registry.en.html\r\n[12]: http://www.oclc.org/developer/develop/web-services/worldcat-search-api.en.html\r\n[13]: http://www.oclc.org/developer/develop/web-services/xid-api.en.html\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
